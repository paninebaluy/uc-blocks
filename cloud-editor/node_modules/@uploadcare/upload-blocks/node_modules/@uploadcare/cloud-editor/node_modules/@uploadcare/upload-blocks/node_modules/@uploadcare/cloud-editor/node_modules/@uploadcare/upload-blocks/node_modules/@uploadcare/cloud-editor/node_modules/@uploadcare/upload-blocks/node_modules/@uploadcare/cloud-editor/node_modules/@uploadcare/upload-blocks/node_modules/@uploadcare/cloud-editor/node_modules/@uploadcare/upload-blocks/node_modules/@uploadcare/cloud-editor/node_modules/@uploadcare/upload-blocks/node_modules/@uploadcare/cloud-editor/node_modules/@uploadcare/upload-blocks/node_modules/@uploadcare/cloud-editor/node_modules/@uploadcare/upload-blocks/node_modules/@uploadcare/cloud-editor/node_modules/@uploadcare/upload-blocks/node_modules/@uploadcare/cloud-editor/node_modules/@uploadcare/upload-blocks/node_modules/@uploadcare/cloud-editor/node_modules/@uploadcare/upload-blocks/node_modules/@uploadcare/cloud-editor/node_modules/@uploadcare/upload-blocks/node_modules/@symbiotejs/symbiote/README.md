# Symbi<span style="color:#f0f">‡∞†</span>te.js

Ultralight and ultrapowerful library to create widgets, organize micro-frontends, build reusable embeddable components and libraries. 
Everything you need for your modern web application!

Symbiote.js is designed to give the level of freedom, as you got with Vanilla JS and to give the convenience level, as you got from modern frameworks at the same time.

## üî• Core benefits
* Minimalistic but reach.
* No additional dependencies.
* Ultralight (~3kb br/gzip for the all BaseComponent features, including data flow).
* Blazing fast.
* Memory friendly (no any redux-like immutables).
* CSP friendly - good for enterprise usage.
* Highly extensible - you can add new custom features with ease.
* Easy to learn - nothing completely new for experienced developers, nothing complicated for newbies.
* Works in all modern browsers. As is.
* Easy to test.
* TypeScript friendly - use it in TS or JS projects from the common source code.
* Integration friendly: works with any modern development stack.
* Lifecycle control: no need to initiate something from outside.
* ESM friendly - native JavaScript modules are best!
* Developer Experience on the mind: compact & convenient APIs, habitual syntax.
* Open source (MIT license).

## üíé Tech concept keypoints
* Native `DocumentFragment` instead of expensive Virtual DOM sync.
* Shadow DOM is optional. Use it when you need it only.
* Styling approach: total freedom, from the old classics to the cutting edge platform abilities.
* Native HTML and DOM API instead of expensive custom template syntax processing.
* Templates are out of the component or render function context. It‚Äôs just a simple JavaScript template literals. So you can keep or process them wherever you want.
* No logical operators in templates. Logic and presentation are strictly separated.
* Fast synchronous UI updates.
* Full data context access from the document structure.
* Full data context availability for template bindings.
* DOM API friendly approach for the most performant solutions.
* Convenient object model access instead of opaque abstractions.
* Custom Elements work strange sometimes. Don‚Äôt worry about that, we do (construction flow).

## üçè Quick start
The easiest way to try Symbiote.js is to create a simple `html` file in your text editor and connect the Symbiote base class from web:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { BaseComponent } from 'https://symbiotejs.github.io/symbiote.js/core/BaseComponent.js';

  class MyComponent extends BaseComponent {
    init$ = {
      count: 0,
      increment: () => {
        this.$.count++;
      },
    }
  }

  MyComponent.template = /*html*/ `
    <h2>{{count}}</h2>
    <button set="onclick: increment">Click me!</button>
  `;

  MyComponent.reg('my-component');
</script>

<my-component></my-component>
```

**This code can work directly in any modern browser, so you don't need to install anything to try it!**
